# BasicTools
A warehouse of basic ICs 

## Purpose
This repository is for basic tools for SLS (Smart Logic Simulator), an app available on Android. It's intended to provide basic building blocks freely available for use by people learning hardware logic, which can be used without cost or explicit permission requirements from the copyright owners (simply honor the MIT licence found in this repository).

## Use
Simply download the files found in the various folders and add them to your SLS projects. Follow any directions in the associated .txt files for each IC to understand how it works and how to use it. Or, open the IC files directly to see how they are built/work. After all, this is an educational project.

## Contributing
We welcome contributors. We ask that you keep your contributions basic and educational. Please select from one of the catagories we have defined, or feel free to create a new category, and send us a pull request. Be sure to include the .txt file (with the same name as your component) describing your component's use cases and usage.

### Naming
TBD
